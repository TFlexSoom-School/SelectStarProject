        <h2>Pages and Descriptions</h2>
        <div>
            <h3><a>players</a></h3>
            <p>
                The players page will list a series of players in the forms of cards. These cards
                will entail the details of each player entity. There will be search box to query 
                for players by name. You can also add players with a modal that will be within this page.
                This is similar to a CS290 project I accomplished 
                <a href="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~hilbertt/cs290/BennysList/">here</a>.
                There will also be a filter box to filter by position. This can be added to similar
                to the city example from the above link (Just with different code). People can also be
                removed from this page, making sure to remove any references alongside.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3><a>teams</a></h3>
            <p>
                Encapsulating the team entity, this page will row by row display the different teams in the
                database. It will have a link to the players page with a pre-queried player search. (This could
                be done through a GET header) It will also link to the respective mascot. Functionality will
                be provided to add teams by using already created players without teams. One may also create a new
                mascot on this page and add it to the respective team. One may also delete teams and mascots from this
                page. Finally, functionality will be here to kick of players from the team.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3><a>games</a></h3>
            <p>
                Similar to above games can be added and deleted from this page. This page will also
                carry links to the teams page and host the mvp of each game. The content will be held
                in rows, but the rows will have large heights. The mvp will only be shown if not null.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3><a>Mascots</a></h3>
            <p>
                Similar to players, a user can query for Mascots. Functionality will be provided to add mascots,
                but they can only be attached to teams without mascots. There is also links to get a detailed view
                of the mascots. One may also delete Mascots from this page.
